# node-db

This repo stores the data used for our [node map](https://nycmesh.net/map).

### Panoramas

Panoramas go in `data/panoramas` and are named according to their node number (227.jpg).
For new installs (which don't have a node number yet) they are named with the install number of the request. (Ie 17754.jpg)
To add multiple panoramas, add a letter to the end of the name (227.jpg, 227a.jpg, 227b.jpg, etc.).

You can access the panoramas at https://node-db.netlify.app/panoramas/227.jpg
