						The NYC Mesh network follows a bottom-up structure where each rooftop-mounted router becomes a source of internet access that can then be distributed to other nodes. Internet connection self-propagates in a mesh network, whereas in traditional ISP access is highly centralized from the top-down. Though NYC Mesh grows from the bottom up, this visualization shows us that there are actually quite clear centralizations and gaps in coverage, especially in the outer-boroughs that need access most. The decentralized Mesh structure has been adapted to provide certain centralities that work within the limits of a non-profit, non-ISP organization. NYC Mesh runs on free labor and donationsâ€” areas with resources and people to dedicate for a free service are usually in more affluent, white neighborhoods. Additionally, Mesh nodes are concentrated in denser areas of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, because Mesh nodes need tall buildings to provide routers with an unobstructed line of sight to other nodes to transmit signal properly. However, the NYC Mesh network operates with the long-run in mind, and hopes that smaller areas of interconnected mesh in Manhattan and Brooklyn will soon lead to a more even distribution over all five boroughs.

						<p> This visualization shows the clusters within the network structure of NYC Mesh as they relate to location and hierarchy. 
							The different node colors indicate which borough the node is located in: Blue is Manhattan, Yellow is Brooklyn, and Red is Queens. 
							The size of nodes indicate building height: the larger the node, the taller the building that the node is attached to. 
							<!-- Additionally, each node appears on the network in the chronological order at which the associated router was added to the WiFi network.  -->
