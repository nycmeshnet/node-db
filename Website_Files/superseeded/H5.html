						Though internet connection often feels abstract and intangible, the physical infrastructure behind the network is rigorous and nuanced. The seemingly invisible connections between our phones and computers are hidden behind the tops of buildings in tangles of cables and wires. The visualization below shows panoramic photos taken by NYC Mesh installation volunteers from the rooftops of different nodes across the network.

						<p>These images serve as a reminder that digital infrastructure, while often abstract, is rooted in place and people.</p>
						<p>Run by and developed for people, 
							NYC Mesh embraces a self-sufficient and informal approach to securing digital inclusion. Mesh internet connections are a tactical intervention that resist the ISP monopoly and represent a kind of guerilla urbanism: making do with what we have to improve our city. </p>
						<p>While the digital infrastructure behind NYC Mesh allows the network to operate technically, the social infrastructure of the network maintains, grows, and strengthens it. The NYC Mesh network is bound by a social fabric of community members who desire to make internet more equitable in NYC.</p>
