						Infrastructure is often far more ambitious than immediate realities. NYC Mesh, by nature of running on a volunteer-based labor structure, is hindered in its ability to connect all of its nodes in a timely fashion. This can lead to “phantom nodes” that have either been installed but not connected, requested but not installed, or otherwise poorly documented and barely in existence.

							Securing connections between all nodes is no easy task on a donation-only policy, but NYC Mesh community members work tirelessly to connect as many people as they can to help work towards a more egalitarian internet in NYC.
